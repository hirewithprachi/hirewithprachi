# Output: /dist or /out folder for Hostinger upload
```

## 🔍 HOSTINGER SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATIONS

### File Structure Best Practices
```
public_html/

├── services/index.html
├── contact/index.html
├── assets/ (CSS, JS, images)
├── .htaccess (URL rewriting)
└── sitemap.xml
```

### Performance Enhancements
- Minify CSS and JavaScript
- Optimize images (WebP format)
- Use CDN links for libraries
- Implement browser caching
- Compress files with gzip

## ✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**YES, it's absolutely possible** to host this on Hostinger shared hosting, but you need to:

1. **Remove server-dependent features** (Next.js API routes, database operations)
2. **Use static site generation** (Vite + React or Next.js export)
3. **Replace backend functionality** with third-party services
4. **Build to /dist folder** for easy upload to Hostinger

The website will still look modern and professional, but some advanced features will work through external services rather than your own server.
