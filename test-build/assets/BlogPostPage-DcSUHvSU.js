Build a Strong Employer Brand</h3>\n      <p>Develop a compelling narrative about your startup\'s mission, culture, and growth opportunities. Use social media, company blogs, and employee testimonials to attract candidates who align with your vision.</p>\n\n      <h3>3. Leverage Your Network</h3>\n      <p>Startup hiring often begins with personal and professional networks. Encourage referrals from current employees, investors, and advisors. These candidates often have better cultural fit and commitment levels.</p>\n\n      <h3>4. Focus on Potential Over Experience</h3>\n      <p>Look for candidates with growth mindset, adaptability, and learning ability rather than just specific experience.
