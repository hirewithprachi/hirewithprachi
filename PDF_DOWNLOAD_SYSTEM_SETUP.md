## 🏗️ **SETUP INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: Database Migration**

Run the database migration via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor:

1. **Go to**: [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) → Your Project → SQL Editor
2. **Copy and paste** the contents of `supabase/migrations/015_pdf_download_system.sql`
3. **Click "Run"** to execute the migration

This will create:
- ✅ `resource_categories` table (HR Templates, Policy Documents, etc.)
- ✅ Enhanced `resources` table with download tracking
- ✅ `resource_downloads` table for tracking all downloads
- ✅ `download_tokens` table for secure download links
- ✅ Database functions for token generation and verification
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Sample data with categories and example resources

### **Step 2: Supabase Storage Setup**

1. **Go to**: Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. **Create a new bucket** called `resource-downloads`
3. **Set bucket as Public** (for file downloads)
4. **Upload sample PDF files** to test the system

Example bucket policies (optional for security):
```sql
-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'resource-downloads');

-- Allow authenticated uploads (admin only)
CREATE POLICY "Admin upload access" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'resource-downloads' 
    AND auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT user_id FROM admin_users WHERE is_active = true
    )
  );
```

### **Step 3: Environment Variables**

Ensure your `.env.local` includes the OpenAI API key:

```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

### **Step 4: Deploy Edge Function (Optional)**

For enhanced security, deploy the download Edge Function:

```bash
npx supabase functions deploy download-resource
```
